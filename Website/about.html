                        Climate change is now widely acknowledged as the major environmental problem facing human civilization. 
                        Its impact and financial losses will be enormous and distributed unevenly across the globe.
                        The main reason behind climate change and global warming is the increase in global carbon footprint. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, consultations on reduction in carbon emissions have largely failed in the past because of lack of trust at the international level and the reluctance of governments to set challenging targets; most of the countries catering to short duration self-interests. 
                        Therefore, it becomes pertinent that various mediums be utilized to increase public awareness about carbon emissions. 
                        The change in perception of general public would eventually put pressure on the respective governments to pay heed to the matter.

                        Owing to the consistently worsening climate and increased public awareness, the global metabolism towards low carbon economies has gradually gained traction.
                        The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) specifies an annual ‘Conference of the Parties’ (COP) between signatories.
                        This year the UK will partner with Italy and host the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference, (COP26), in Glasgow during November 2021.
                        The COP21 Paris Agreement entailed pledges called Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) delineating their plans to respond to climate change.
                        It also contains the ‘ratchet mechanism’ that necessitates co-signers to re-evaluate their NDC every 5 years and try and step up their efforts in the NDCs.
                        The preliminary set of targets will be shared and negotiated at COP26. This is a critical conference for the future, as it will establish the standards for the ambitiousness of the ‘ratcheting mechanism’

                        To achieve success at COP26 it is essential for the public around the world, to be aware of the conference, its aims and the current state of global greenhouse emissions.
                        To help achieve this success, Team WIN have created a website which aims to increase public awareness of the COP26 conference and produce an accessible and interactive 3D web visualisation of current global emissions relative to the projected emission targets in 2030.
                        The project aims to increase public perception of the trajectory of signatory states in reaching their NDC aims.
                        Through public awareness of the insufficiency of the current NDCs, we aim to stress on signatory states to use the agreed ratcheting mechanism in order to enhance their ambitions in climate mitigation.
